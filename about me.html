    <p>
      After four years as an educator, I decided to pursue a long-standing
      passion: coding and web development. I am currently building my skills in
      front-end web development, focusing on technologies like HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript, with the goal of becoming a full-stack engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m excited to immerse myself in the tech industry, where I can learn from
      experienced developers and deepen my understanding of the craft. My
      ultimate goal is to combine my teaching background with my love for
      coding—whether that means creating educational tools or helping others
      learn to code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a lifelong learner, committed to growth and exploration. This journey
      is just beginning, and I’m dedicated to making the most of it!
